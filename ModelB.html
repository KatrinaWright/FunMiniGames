    <h1>Kindergarten Computer Science Course Description</h1>
    <h2>Purpose & Objectives</h2>
    <p>Welcome to this beginner-friendly Computer Science course designed specifically for your kindergarten student! The goal is to introduce your young learner to the exciting world of computers in a simple, engaging, and hands-on way. By the end of this course, your student will understand what a computer is, recognize its basic parts, and begin to see how computers help us every day. This "open_and_go" course requires no prior preparation—just follow the lesson, quiz, and assignment as provided, and watch your student take their first steps into technology!</p>

    <h2>Subject Background</h2>
    <p>Computer Science is all about understanding how computers work and how we can use them to solve problems or create fun things. For a kindergarten student, this means starting with the basics: what a computer looks like, what it does, and how it fits into their world. Since your student’s profile is a "test" with no specific technology preferences, we’ll focus on foundational ideas that spark curiosity and build confidence, setting the stage for future learning.</p>

    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>This course is structured as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Topic: Introduction to Computers</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Exploring What Computers Do</li>
                <li><strong>Quiz:</strong> Quiz: Computer Basics</li>

    <!-- Lesson -->
    <h1>Lesson: Exploring What Computers Do</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello, teacher! Today, you’re going to introduce your kindergarten student to the amazing world of computers. This lesson is designed to be simple and fun, perfect for a beginner. You’ll help your student understand what a computer is, explore its basic parts, and see how it helps us in everyday life. No preparation is needed—just follow this "open_and_go" guide, gather a few crayons and paper, and get ready to spark curiosity!</p>
    <p>Start by asking your student: “Have you ever seen a computer?” Let them share what they know. Then, guide them through this lesson with hands-on examples and questions to keep them engaged.</p>

    <h2>Deep Context & Background</h2>
    <p>A computer is a special machine that helps us do all kinds of things, like play games, watch cartoons, or learn new stuff. For your kindergarten student, think of it as a magic helper! Computers have parts like a screen (where you see pictures), a keyboard (where you type), and a mouse (to point and click). These parts work together to follow our instructions.</p>
    <p>Long ago, computers were huge and only grown-ups used them for big jobs, like counting numbers. Now, they’re everywhere—on desks, in schools, even in toys! This lesson focuses on what computers do today and how your student can start noticing them. For example, a computer at home might help you find a recipe, while one at school might show a fun video.</p>
    <p>To teach this, use a real computer if you have one. Point to the screen and say, “This is where we see things.” Show the keyboard and explain, “This is how we tell the computer what to do.” Keep it simple and let your student touch or point to the parts as you go.</p>

    <h2>Key Events, Factors, or Contributors</h2>
    <p>Computers didn’t just appear—they were invented by smart people! A long time ago, in the 1940s, machines called ENIAC were some of the first computers. They were as big as a classroom and very slow. People like Alan Turing helped make computers better by figuring out how to give them instructions.</p>
    <p>Today, computers are small and fast because of tiny parts called “chips.” These chips are like the brain of the computer. For your student, you can say, “A computer has a brain inside that helps it think!” Show them a picture of an old, big computer (find one online) and compare it to a laptop or tablet they know.</p>
    <p>Another big factor is how we use computers now. They’re not just for work—they’re for fun, too! Your student might use a computer to draw or play a game. Point out examples they’ve seen, like a TV screen showing a movie (that’s a computer working!). This helps them connect the idea to their world.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies & Notable Examples</h2>
    <p>Let’s look at some fun examples! First, think of a tablet like an iPad. It’s a computer your student might use to watch a show or play a learning game. Show them one (or a picture) and say, “This is a computer! It has a screen to see and buttons to touch.”</p>
    <p>Second, talk about a school computer. Maybe it’s in the classroom or library. It helps kids read stories or practice letters. Ask, “Have you used a computer at school? What did it do?” Let them share.</p>
    <p>Finally, mention a toy computer—like a learning laptop for kids. These have bright buttons and sounds. If you have one, show it and say, “Even toys can be computers!” These examples make the idea real and exciting for your student.</p>

    <h2>Vocabulary & Research Prompts</h2>
    <p>Here are key words to teach:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Computer:</strong> A machine that helps us do things like play or learn.</li>
        <li><strong>Screen:</strong> The part of the computer we look at.</li>
        <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> The part with buttons we press to type.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ask your student: “Can you point to the screen on a computer?” or “What do you think the keyboard does?” These prompts help them learn by doing.</p>

    <h2>Critical Thinking & Discussion Questions</h2>
    <p>Ask these to get your student thinking:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“What’s one thing you like to do that a computer could help with?”</li>
        <li>“Why do you think computers have screens?”</li>
        <li>“Can you name something at home that might be a computer?”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Listen to their answers and praise their ideas. If they’re stuck, suggest things like “watching a cartoon” or “playing a game.”</p>
