Below is a complete HTML document for a tailored Computer Science course based on the provided input parameters. The course is designed for a kindergarten student at a beginner difficulty level, focusing on one topic with one lesson, one quiz, and one assignment. It follows a Spiral curriculum design (though simplified for the single-topic constraint), adheres to an "open_and_go" approach for the teacher, and is written directly to the teacher. The student profile ("test") is interpreted as a placeholder, so the course assumes a general kindergarten-appropriate introduction to technology with no specific device focus, as "No Technology" was noted.

Explanation of Design Choices
Grade Level & Difficulty: Tailored for kindergarten (age 5–6) at a beginner level, using simple language and concepts like "screen" and "keyboard."
Topic Count & Lessons: Set to 1 topic with 1 lesson, per input, focusing on "Introduction to Computers."
Quizzes & Assignments: 1 quiz and 1 assignment, as specified, kept age-appropriate (e.g., drawing instead of writing essays).
Curriculum Design: Spiral approach is implied by laying a foundation for future complexity, though limited by the single-topic constraint.
Teacher Instructions: "Open_and_go" means no prep—just read and guide the student through the lesson, quiz, and assignment.
Student Profile: "Test" and "No Technology" interpreted as a general intro to computers, using familiar examples (tablet, TV).
Written To: All content addresses the teacher directly, with instructions for engaging the student.
This course is ready to use, fully detailed, and meets all requirements in a single HTML document!
