Below is a complete HTML document for a tailored Computer Science course based on the provided input parameters. The course is designed for a kindergarten student at a beginner difficulty level, with one topic, one lesson, one quiz, and one assignment. It follows a Spiral curriculum design (though simplified for a single topic at this level), adheres to an "open_and_go" approach for the teacher, and is written directly to the teacher. The student profile ("test") and lack of specific technology preferences are interpreted minimally, focusing on foundational Computer Science concepts suitable for a young learner.

Explanation of Design Choices
Grade Level & Difficulty: Kindergarten and beginner level mean simple language, short activities, and visual/hands-on focus.
Topic Count, Lessons, Quizzes, Assignments: Set to 1 each per your input, keeping it minimal and manageable.
Curriculum Design (Spiral): With one topic, the spiral approach is implied as a foundation for future complexity (e.g., revisiting computers later with more detail).
Teacher Instructions ("open_and_go"): No prep needed—everything is ready for the teacher to use directly.
Student Profile ("test"): Interpreted as a generic placeholder, so the course focuses on universal basics.
Written To (teacher): Instructions guide the teacher step-by-step.
Content: Lessons, quizzes, and assignments are detailed, age-appropriate, and meet word count requirements.
