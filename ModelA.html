<h1>Course Description</h1>
<h2>Purpose & Objectives</h2>
<p>Welcome to this Kindergarten Computer Science course! This course is designed to introduce you, the teacher, to an "open_and_go" plan that brings the exciting world of computers to your young student. Our goal is to spark curiosity about technology in a simple, engaging way. By the end, your student will understand what a computer is, recognize its basic parts, and see how it helps us every day—all tailored to a beginner level for kindergarten.</p>

<h2>Subject Background</h2>
<p>Computer Science is all about understanding how computers work and how we use them to solve problems or have fun. For a kindergarten student, this means starting with the basics: what a computer looks like, what it does, and why it matters. Since your student’s profile is a "test" case with no specific technology preferences, we’ll focus on a general, hands-on introduction that fits their age and beginner skill level.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Topic: Introduction to Computers</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Lesson 1: What Is a Computer?</li>
            <li>Quiz 1: Computer Basics</li>
            <li>Assignment 1: Draw Your Computer</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, your student will be able to:
<ul>
    <li>Identify a computer and name at least two parts (e.g., screen, keyboard).</li>
    <li>Describe one way we use computers (e.g., playing games, learning).</li>
    <li>Create a simple drawing of a computer, showing their understanding.</li>
</ul>
These skills lay the foundation for future Computer Science learning in a Spiral approach, where concepts will grow more complex over time.</p>

<h2>Relevant Context</h2>
<p>Computers have been around since the 1940s, when big machines helped solve math problems. Today, they’re everywhere—helping us talk to friends, play games, or even draw pictures! This course connects your student to this history by showing how computers are tools we use every day, starting with the simplest ideas they can grasp.</p>

<!-- Lesson 1 -->
<h1>Lesson 1: What Is a Computer?</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello, teacher! Today, you’ll guide your kindergarten student through their first step into Computer Science with this "open_and_go" lesson. No preparation is needed—just follow along! This lesson introduces the idea of a computer in a way that’s fun and simple for a five- or six-year-old. You’ll use everyday examples, like a tablet or TV, to show what a computer is and what it does. By the end, your student will be excited to learn more about this amazing tool!</p>

<h2>Deep Context & Background</h2>
<p>A computer is a machine that helps us do things like play games, watch videos, or draw pictures. For your kindergarten student, think of it as a "magic helper." Long ago, computers were huge—like the size of a room! They were used to count numbers or solve big problems. Now, they’re small enough to fit in our hands, like a phone or tablet. This lesson keeps it simple: a computer is something with a screen and buttons (or a keyboard) that follows our instructions. Your student will start by recognizing computers they see every day, setting the stage for deeper learning later.</p>

<h2>Key Events, Factors, or Contributors</h2>
<p>Computers didn’t just appear—they were invented by smart people! In the 1940s, a man named Alan Turing helped make early computers that solved secret codes during a war. His ideas are why computers can "think" today. Later, in the 1970s, companies like Apple and Microsoft made computers small and easy for everyone to use. For your student, focus on this: computers started big and tricky, but now they’re simple and fun! Show them a picture of an old computer (big and boxy) versus a modern one (like a laptop). This history shows how computers changed to help us more.</p>

<h2>Case Studies & Notable Examples</h2>
<p>Let’s make it real for your student! Example 1: A tablet they might use to watch cartoons is a computer—it has a screen and buttons, and it follows what they tap. Example 2: A school computer with a keyboard lets them type or play learning games. Example 3: Even a smart TV is a computer because it shows videos when we pick them. Point out these examples in your classroom or home. Say, “See this? It’s a computer because it helps us do things!” This keeps it beginner-friendly and connects to their world.</p>

<h2>Vocabulary & Research Prompts</h2>
<p><strong>Vocabulary:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Computer:</strong> A machine with a screen and buttons that helps us do things.</li>
    <li><strong>Screen:</strong> The part of a computer we look at, like a TV.</li>
    <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> The buttons we press to tell the computer what to do.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Prompts:</strong> Ask your student, “What do you use that has a screen?” or “Can you find something in the room that might be a computer?”</p>

<h2>Critical Thinking & Discussion Questions</h2>
<p>Here are questions to ask your student:</p>
<ul>
    <li>“What do you think a computer can do for us?” (Look for answers like “play games” or “show pictures.”)</li>
    <li>“How is a tablet like a computer at school?” (Guide them to see both have screens.)</li>
    <li>“Why do we need computers?” (Help them say things like “to learn” or “to have fun.”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep it light and playful—let them share ideas!</p>
